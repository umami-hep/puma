    Parameters
    ----------
    targets : np.ndarray
        target labels
    predictions : np.ndarray
        predicted labels (output of the classifier)
    sample_weights : np.ndarray, optional
        Weight of each sample; if None, each sample weights the same. Defaults to None.
    normalize : str | None, optional
        Normalization of the confusion matrix. Can be:
        None : Give raw counts;
        "rownorm": Normalize across the prediction class, i.e. such that the rows add to one;
        "colnorm": Normalize across the target class, i.e. such that the columns add to one;
        "all" : Normalize across all examples, i.e. such that all matrix entries add to one.
        Defaults to "rownorm".

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray : the confusion matrix.
