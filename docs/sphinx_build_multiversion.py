"""Script to loop over a number of git branches/tags, check them out and build the
the sphinx docs.
The branches/tags for which the docs are generated are defined in the file
"docs/source/_static/switcher.json" (note that the docs do not use the local version
by default, but instead the version from the latest commit on GH-Pages. This is due to
the fact that this button prefers urls instead of local filenames).
