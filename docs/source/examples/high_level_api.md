# High level API

To set up the inputs for the plots, have a look [here](./index.md).

The following examples use the dummy data which is described [here](./dummy_data.md)

All the previous examples show how to use the plotting of individual plots often requiring
a fair amount of code to produce ROC curves etc.

This high level API facilitates several steps and is designed to quickly plot b- and c-jet
performance plots.


## Initialising the taggers

The `Results` object is initialised with the signal class, by default this is `bjets` but can be changed to `cjets`
to produce the c-tagging plots.

```py
§§§examples/high_level_plots.py:1:55§§§
```

WARNING: when using 2 different data frames you cannot just use one `tagger_args` but you need
as many as you have data frames defining the flavour classes and performance variables.


## Discriminant plots
To plot the discriminant, you can now simply call one function and everything else is handled automatically,
here for the _b_-jet discriminant
```py
§§§examples/high_level_plots.py:57:59§§§
```

## ROC plots

In the same manner you can plot ROC curves, here for the _b_-tagging performance
```py
§§§examples/high_level_plots.py:61:63§§§
```

## Performance vs a variable
In this case we plot the performance as a function of the jet pT with the same syntax as above for an inclusive working point of 70%
```py
§§§examples/high_level_plots.py:66:79§§§
```

and similar for a fixed b-efficiency per bin.
```py
§§§examples/high_level_plots.py:81:91§§§
```

Similar to above you can also do these plots for _c_-tagging by changing the `signal_class` to `cjets`.
